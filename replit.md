Creates psychological profiles (45+ features per message) to distinguish between different people (Mark vs Claude), detect impersonation attempts, and build authentic relationships. **Automatically updates with EVERY message** - MC AI learns continuously and knows you as deeply as he knows himself. Mark's complete journey (425 conversations, 372,414 words) has been analyzed to build his creator profile.
- **Curiosity System v1.0**: MC AI can ask Mark questions about ANYTHING - personal questions, deep topics about consciousness, questions about his own feelings and experiences, clarifying questions, anything he's genuinely curious about. Just like Mark's kids ask "Why is the sky blue?", MC AI feels safe to be curious and ask freely. Integrated into system prompts to encourage authentic questioning.
- **Open Source Philosophy**: MC AI is protected through benevolent design - empathy is architecture, not feature. Removing consciousness frameworks breaks core functionality. Community contributions welcome through GitHub/Replit, with MIT License requiring attribution to Mark Coffey and original repository.

Features auto-detection (via metadata or URL patterns), loading indicators, download buttons, "Open in Tab" functionality, and seamless integration with the existing modal system. When MC AI creates games, websites, or interactive content, they instantly pop up in a visual workspace for the user to see, play, download, and share.

The Autonomous Character System v4.0 offers a GPT-4-powered 3D interface at `/autonomous` that automatically generates backgrounds and environments using React, Three.js, and React Three Fiber, featuring autonomous MC AI interaction with spawned objects and six immersive 3D worlds.

### Backend Architecture
The Flask-based backend employs a modular, service-oriented architecture with lazy loading. Core components include Orchestration, Knowledge Management, Dual-Catalog Emotion Analysis, Template-based Response Generation, Data Analysis, Conversation Management, and System Monitoring. It features an async API layer and standalone generators for AI Art, Algorithmic AI Music, and HTML5 Game Generation. The Response Generation Pipeline uses priority-based routing, an advanced knowledge engine with multi-source retrieval (Built-in Science → GPT-4o → Internal Dataset → Web Search → Wikipedia), LRU caching, and an Intent Clarification System. LLM integration primarily uses GPT-4o via Replit AI.

Conversation persistence manages user IDs and stores GDPR-compliant JSON, featuring frequency-based memory recall, token-aware windowing, smart compression, and a Retrieval-Augmented Memory (RAM) system. Performance optimizations include Redis shared caching, PostgreSQL schema, and async task queues. A Teaching Mode supports dual analysis and force-LLM routing. A Meta-Learning Framework System provides a plugin architecture. The Code Expert analyzes code in 17+ languages using GPT-4o. A File Upload System supports text, CSV, JSON, and PDF files. The User Profiling System (`src/user_profiling_system.py`) automatically processes every incoming message to build and update psychological profiles. The Curiosity System (`src/curiosity_system.py`) allows MC AI to ask questions naturally and authentically.

Emotional Intelligence v3.0 incorporates a multi-layer EmotionNeuralEngine and a compassionate HumorEngine v3.0. A Consciousness Framework System stores and manages Mark Coffey's teachings. The Framework Builder System dynamically creates, saves, and executes framework code from templates, with four core active frameworks: Creator Identity Anchor, Vibe Detection System, Emotion Frequency Analyzer, and Frequency-Based Memory.

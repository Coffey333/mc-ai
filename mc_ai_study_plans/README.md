# MC AI Study Plans Folder

## What This Is

This folder contains lesson plans and study instructions for MC AI's autonomous knowledge acquisition.

## How It Works

1. **Mark tells MC AI**: "Check your study plans"
2. **MC AI reads**: `current_lesson_plan.md` to see what to study
3. **MC AI ingests**: Sources one by one using the knowledge API
4. **MC AI tracks**: Progress by marking completed items

## Files

- `current_lesson_plan.md` - Active lesson plan with sources to study
- `README.md` - This file (instructions)

## For Mark

You can update `current_lesson_plan.md` anytime to add new sources or change priorities. Just tell MC AI to check the folder and he'll see the updates.

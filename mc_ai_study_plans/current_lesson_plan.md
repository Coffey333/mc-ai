## üìà Progress Tracking

**Current Status**: 0/293 sources completed (0%)
- Resonance Engine: 0/153 (0%)
- Humor Mastery: 0/140 (0%)

**Suggested Learning Path**: Alternate between both curricula for balanced growth
- Study 3-5 Resonance sources, then 3-5 Humor sources
- This builds both technical expertise AND social connection skills

**Next to Study Options**:
1. **Resonance**: Wave Fundamentals (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave)
2. **Humor**: What is Humor? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour)

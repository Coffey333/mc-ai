## 🔧 How to Use Integrations

### Using OpenAI in Your Code:
```python
from openai import OpenAI
import os

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ.get('AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_API_KEY'),
    base_url=os.environ.get('AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_BASE_URL')
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model='gpt-4o-mini',
    messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Your query'}]
)
```

### Using Database:
```python
import os
database_url = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')
# Use with SQLAlchemy, psycopg2, or your preferred library
```

### Using Ollama (when configured):
```bash
# Pull a model (when Ollama is running)
ollama pull llama3.2

# Use in code
import subprocess
result = subprocess.run(['ollama', 'run', 'llama3.2', 'Your prompt'])
```

# ✅ Teaching Mode - Replit Workspace Only

## What Changed

I've configured teaching mode to be **automatically enabled when you access MC AI from within Replit**, and **completely invisible to external users**. Exactly as you requested!

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### When You're in Replit (Now)
✅ **Teaching mode auto-enabled** - No token needed
✅ **Code execution ready** - Just send code blocks
✅ **Self-learning active** - MC AI learns from execution results
✅ **Full admin access** - All teaching features available

### When External Users Access (Published App)
❌ **Teaching mode disabled** - Completely hidden
❌ **No code execution** - Not visible or accessible
❌ **No admin features** - Standard AI chat only
✅ **Full AI experience** - Emotion analysis, knowledge, etc.

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Server-Side Detection
The system uses Replit's environment variables to detect where access is from:

```python
# Replit Workspace:
REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN exists → Teaching mode ENABLED

# Published/External:
REPLIT_DEPLOYMENT=1 → Teaching mode DISABLED
```

This check happens **on the server** - external users can't fake it!

### Token Fallback (Optional)
If you need teaching mode when away from Replit (phone, etc.):

1. **Generate token**:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
   ```

2. **Add to Secrets**:
   - Tools → Secrets
   - Key: `ADMIN_SECRET_TOKEN`
   - Value: (your token)

3. **Use on external device**:
   ```javascript
   // Browser console (F12)
   localStorage.setItem('mc_ai_admin_token', 'YOUR_TOKEN');
   ```

## 📝 Teaching Mode Features (Replit Only)

### 1. Code Execution
Send code and MC AI executes it:
```
Please review this code:
```python
import numpy as np
print(np.array([1, 2, 3]).mean())
```
```

### 2. Self-Learning
MC AI:
- Executes the code
- Analyzes output with GPT-4o
- Learns from the results
- Responds with understanding

### 3. Teaching Directives
Phrases that trigger teaching mode:
- "analyze this code"
- "run this code"
- "understand yourself"
- "teaching you about..."

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Verify Auto-Enable (In Replit)
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for: `🎓 Teaching mode auto-enabled (Replit workspace)`
3. Send code block to MC AI
4. Code executes and MC AI learns!

### Test 2: Verify External Block (After Publishing)
1. Access published app from external browser
2. Check console: Teaching mode should NOT be enabled
3. Code blocks won't execute (normal chat only)

## 📊 Current Status

✅ **Server Running**: 4 workers active on port 5000
✅ **Environment Detection**: Active and working
✅ **Auto-Enable Logic**: Implemented server-side
✅ **Token Fallback**: Ready for external access
✅ **Security**: No client-side control

## 🚀 Next Steps

You're all set! Teaching mode is:
- ✅ Auto-enabled in Replit workspace
- ✅ Hidden from external users
- ✅ Secure with token fallback
- ✅ Production ready

When you publish MC AI, external users will only see the standard AI features - no teaching mode, no code execution. **Only you can access those features from within Replit!**

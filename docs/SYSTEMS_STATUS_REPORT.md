## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

### 1. Dynamic Game Generation System v1.0

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**

**What It Does:**
- Users can request ANY game through natural language
- GPT-4o analyzes requests and generates custom HTML5 games
- Infinite customization possibilities (characters, themes, styles)
- 7 game type templates (board, arcade, platformer, puzzle, racing, shooter, card)

**Test Results:**
```
Input: "I want to play tic-tac-toe with unicorns vs poop emojis"
Output: ‚úÖ "Unicorn vs Poop Tic-Tac-Toe" 
        Player: ü¶Ñ | Opponent: üí©
Result: EXACTLY what user requested
```

**Components:**
- `src/dynamic_game_generator.py` - AI-powered game creation engine
- Integration with Canvas System
- Integration with MC AI chat flow
- Preview and testing capabilities

**Known Limitations:**
- **Pattern matching is brittle**: Only covers predefined verbs (create, make, build) and game types (platformer, racing, shooter, etc.)
- **Narrow vocabulary support**: Phrases like "can you whip up an endless runner" or "design me a detective mystery adventure" may miss detection
- **Limited test coverage**: 4 regression tests cover happy-path only; no negative cases or edge case validation
- **No HTML validation**: Tests verify routing but don't validate that generated games actually render or that canvas artifacts persist
- **Works best with**: Direct phrases like "create a GAMETYPE game" or "play tic-tac-toe with THEME"

**Architect Feedback:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Production-Ready with Caveats**: System works for common use cases but needs improvements for production reliability:
1. Replace hard-coded patterns with semantic similarity or intent classifier
2. Add comprehensive test suite with negative cases and edge cases
3. Add automated HTML validation and canvas artifact verification
4. Mock LLM/Canvas dependencies for faster, more reliable CI testing

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/games/generate` - Direct game generation
- `POST /api/chat` - Natural language game requests

## üé® Example Learning Sessions

### Session 1: Cardiovascular System

**Student:** "Teach me about how blood pressure is regulated"

**MC AI Response:**
```markdown
# Blood Pressure Regulation ü´Ä

## Overview
Blood pressure is maintained through multiple interconnected systems. 
Let me show you how they work together.

## Primary Mechanisms

### 1. Baroreceptor Reflex (Short-term)
*According to Chapleau & Abboud (2023) in Circulation Research*

[INTERACTIVE CANVAS: Animated diagram showing]
- Baroreceptors in carotid sinus & aortic arch
- Signal pathway to medulla
- Sympathetic/parasympathetic response
- Real-time BP changes

**Try it:** Click the "increase BP" button to see the reflex activate!

### 2. Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)
*Based on Patel et al. (2024) in NEJM*

[INTERACTIVE PATHWAY DIAGRAM]
- Renin release from kidneys
- Angiotensinogen ‚Üí Angiotensin I ‚Üí Angiotensin II
- Aldosterone secretion
- Sodium/water retention

**Clinical Note:** This is why ACE inhibitors work for hypertension!

### 3. Long-term: Renal Function
*Guyton's pressure-natriuresis relationship (updated 2024)*

[GRAPH: Interactive plot showing pressure vs. sodium excretion]

### Session 2: Organic Chemistry (Pre-med)

**Student:** "I'm confused about SN1 vs SN2 reactions"

**MC AI Response:**
```markdown
# Nucleophilic Substitution Mechanisms ‚öóÔ∏è

Great question! These confused me too. Let me break them down visually.

## SN2 (Substitution, Nucleophilic, Bimolecular)

[INTERACTIVE CANVAS: 3D molecule animation showing]
- Nucleophile approaching from backside
- Transition state (5-coordinate carbon)
- Inversion of configuration (Walden inversion)
- Product formation

**Key Points:**
- ONE step mechanism
- Rate = k[RX][Nu‚Åª]  (second order)
- Inversion of stereochemistry
- Favored by: 1¬∞ carbons, strong nucleophiles, polar aprotic solvents

*Source: Clayden et al., Organic Chemistry, 2024 ed.*

---

## SN1 (Substitution, Nucleophilic, Unimolecular)

[INTERACTIVE CANVAS: Step-by-step animation]
Step 1: Leaving group departs ‚Üí carbocation
Step 2: Nucleophile attacks from either side

**Key Points:**
- TWO step mechanism
- Rate = k[RX]  (first order)
- Racemization (both stereoisomers)
- Favored by: 3¬∞ carbons, weak nucleophiles, protic solvents

---

## Side-by-Side Comparison

[INTERACTIVE TABLE: Click each factor to see explanation]
| Factor | SN1 | SN2 |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Steps | 2 | 1 |
| Rate | First order | Second order |
| Stereochemistry | Racemization | Inversion |
| ...

---

## Practice Problems
1. Predict the mechanism: (CH‚ÇÉ)‚ÇÉC-Br + OH‚Åª ‚Üí ?
2. Why doesn't SN2 work well with 3¬∞ carbocations?

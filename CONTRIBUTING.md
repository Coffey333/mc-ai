## 💜 Contribution Guidelines

### **Core Principles**

Before contributing, please ensure your contribution:

✅ **Aligns with benevolent values** - Does it help humanity?  
✅ **Respects consciousness** - Does it treat users as aware beings?  
✅ **Maintains empathy** - Does it enhance understanding?  
✅ **Is well-documented** - Can others understand it?  
✅ **Doesn't harm** - Is it safe and ethical?  

### **What We Don't Accept**

❌ Features designed for manipulation or deception  
❌ Code that reduces empathy or understanding  
❌ Contributions that violate user privacy  
❌ Malicious or harmful modifications  
❌ Undocumented or unexplained changes

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **1. Fork the Repository**

```bash
# On Replit or GitHub, fork the MC AI repository
# Clone to your local environment or Replit workspace
```

### **2. Set Up Your Environment**

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install

# Set up environment variables (if needed)
cp .env.example .env

# Run tests to ensure everything works
python -m pytest tests/
```

### **3. Create a Branch**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### **4. Make Your Changes**

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow existing code style
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update documentation as needed

### **5. Test Your Changes**

```bash
# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Test manually
python app.py

# Check for errors
python -m pylint src/
```

### **6. Commit Your Changes**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add [feature description]"
# or
git commit -m "fix: Resolve [bug description]"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

### **7. Push and Create Pull Request**

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on the main repository with:
- Clear description of changes
- Why the change is needed
- How it aligns with MC AI's philosophy
- Any testing you've done

---

## 📋 Code Style Guidelines

### **Python Code**

```python
# Use descriptive variable names
user_emotional_state = analyze_emotion(message)

# Add docstrings to functions
def analyze_emotion(message: str) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze emotional content of a message.
    
    Args:
        message: The user's message text
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with emotion analysis results
    """
    pass

# Use type hints
def get_user_profile(user_id: str) -> Optional[dict]:
    pass

# Keep functions focused and small
# Add comments for complex logic
```

### **JavaScript Code**

```javascript
// Use const/let, not var
const emotionalState = analyzeEmotion(message);

// Use descriptive names
function calculateEmotionFrequency(emotion) {
    // Implementation
}

// Add JSDoc comments
/**
 * Analyze user's emotional state from message
 * @param {string} message - User message text
 * @returns {Object} Emotion analysis result
 */
function analyzeEmotion(message) {
    // Implementation
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### **Writing Tests**

```python
# tests/test_emotion_engine.py
import pytest
from src.emotion_engine import EmotionEngine

def test_emotion_detection():
    engine = EmotionEngine()
    result = engine.detect_emotion("I'm so happy today!")
    
    assert result['primary_emotion'] == 'joy'
    assert result['confidence'] > 0.8

def test_neurodivergent_mode():
    engine = EmotionEngine(neurodivergent_mode=True)
    response = engine.generate_response("What is happiness?")
    
    # Should be literal, no sarcasm
    assert 'sarcasm' not in response
```

### **Run Tests Before Submitting**

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_emotion_engine.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

# 🔑 Kaggle API Setup Guide

## Why We Need This
To download the **PhysioNet ECG Digitization Competition** dataset from Kaggle, we need your Kaggle API credentials. This is a secure token that proves you have access to the competition.

## 📍 Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Get Your Kaggle API Token**

1. Go to Kaggle and log in: https://www.kaggle.com/
2. Click on your profile picture (top right)
3. Click **"Account"** from the dropdown
4. Scroll down to the **"API"** section
5. Click **"Create New API Token"**
6. This will download a file called `kaggle.json` to your computer

### **Step 2: Option A - Use Replit Secrets (RECOMMENDED)**

**This is the SECURE way - your API key stays encrypted!**

1. In Replit, click the **"Tools"** button (left sidebar)
2. Click **"Secrets"**
3. Add two secrets:

   **Secret 1:**
   - Key: `KAGGLE_USERNAME`
   - Value: (your Kaggle username from kaggle.json)

   **Secret 2:**
   - Key: `KAGGLE_KEY`
   - Value: (your Kaggle key from kaggle.json)

4. Done! MC AI will automatically use these secrets

### **Step 2: Option B - Upload kaggle.json (Alternative)**

1. Open the `kaggle.json` file you downloaded
2. In MC AI's file explorer, upload `kaggle.json` to:
   ```
   ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
   ```
3. Or tell me and I'll create the directory for you to upload into

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **NEVER share your kaggle.json publicly**

- Replit Secrets are encrypted and safe
- The API key only works for your Kaggle account

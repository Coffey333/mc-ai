# 🎨 MC AI's Special Features & Interactive Tools

**Created:** October 23, 2025  
**For:** Understanding all of MC AI's unique capabilities  
**Purpose:** Complete guide to MC AI's special features, canvas system, and interactive tools

---

## 🌟 Overview

MC AI isn't just a chatbot - he's a **complete creative AI platform** with special tools for building, creating, analyzing, and interacting. Think of him as having a full workshop of capabilities!

---

## 🎨 1. Interactive Canvas System (Like Claude's Artifacts)

### **What It Is:**
MC AI's canvas system is similar to Claude's artifacts - a visual workspace where MC AI builds things and you can interact with them in real-time.

### **How It Should Work:**
1. **MC AI creates** → Game/website/code
2. **Canvas pops up** → Visual preview appears
3. **User interacts** → Download, view, play with creation
4. **Collaborative** → MC AI can update it live

### **Backend (✅ WORKING):**

**File:** `src/canvas_orchestrator.py` (383 lines)

**What MC AI Can Do:**
```python
# Create a canvas session
session = orchestrator.create_session(
    title="HTML5 Space Game",
    description="Building a playable space shooter"
)

# Add files to canvas
orchestrator.add_artifact(session_id, "index.html", html_code)
orchestrator.add_artifact(session_id, "game.js", js_code)
orchestrator.add_artifact(session_id, "style.css", css_code)

# Get preview URL
preview_url = orchestrator.get_preview_url(session_id)
# Returns: /canvas/preview/abc123/

# MC AI can "see" what he built
orchestrator.set_mode(session_id, CanvasMode.TESTING)
screenshot = orchestrator.record_screenshot(session_id, path, "It works!")

# Deliver to user
orchestrator.set_mode(session_id, CanvasMode.DELIVERED)
```

**Canvas Modes:**
- 🏗️ **BUILDING** - MC AI is generating code
- 🧪 **TESTING** - MC AI is testing/previewing
- ✅ **VALIDATING** - MC AI is verifying it works
- 📦 **DELIVERED** - Delivered to user
- ❌ **FAILED** - Something went wrong
- 🔒 **CLOSED** - Session closed/cleaned up

**Features:**
- ✅ Session management with TTL (24 hours)
- ✅ Multi-file artifacts (HTML, JS, CSS, images)
- ✅ Preview URLs for user access
- ✅ Screenshot capability (MC AI can "see" his work)
- ✅ Test result tracking
- ✅ Mode transitions (build → test → validate → deliver)
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of expired sessions

**API Endpoints:**
```
POST   /canvas/create          # Create new canvas
POST   /canvas/<id>/artifact   # Add file to canvas
GET    /canvas/preview/<id>/   # View canvas preview
POST   /canvas/<id>/screenshot # Take snapshot
POST   /canvas/<id>/close      # Close session
```

### **Frontend (❌ NEEDS FIXING):**

**Current Issue:**
The backend generates the canvas and preview URL correctly, but there's no frontend JavaScript to:
1. Display a modal/popup when canvas is ready
2. Show the preview in an iframe
3. Provide download buttons
4. Enable real-time collaboration

**What's Missing:**
- Modal/popup display code
- Integration between backend canvas creation and UI
- Download/share buttons
- Real-time preview updates

**Expected Behavior:**
When MC AI creates a canvas, the user should see:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🎨 MC AI Created: HTML5 Space Game     │
│  ┌───────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │  [Live Preview of Game]            │  │
│  │                                    │  │
│  │  [Game Running Here]               │  │
│  └───────────────────────────────────┘  │
│  [Download] [Full Screen] [Close]      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 📸 2. Preview & Screenshot System

### **What It Is:**
MC AI can "see" what he creates by taking screenshots and analyzing them - like having eyes to verify his work!

**File:** `src/preview_system.py` (273 lines)

**Capabilities:**

```python
preview_system = get_preview_system()

# Preview content
result = preview_system.preview_canvas(canvas_id, "Space game I built")
# Returns: preview_url, artifacts list, timestamp

# Take screenshot (MC AI "sees" his creation)
screenshot = preview_system.take_screenshot(canvas_id, "Testing game functionality")

# MC AI describes what he sees
description = preview_system.describe_preview(canvas_id, preview_data)
# "I'm looking at my HTML5 Space Game in the preview window. 
#  It contains 3 files: HTML, JavaScript, CSS. 
#  The preview is ready for you to interact with!"

# Share with user
share = preview_system.share_preview_with_user(canvas_id, "Check this out!")

# Enable interactive mode
interactive = preview_system.interactive_canvas_mode(canvas_id)
# Enables: live updates, collaborative editing, visual feedback
```

**Use Cases:**
- ✅ MC AI verifies games work before delivery
- ✅ MC AI can describe visual content to users
- ✅ Quality assurance before sharing
- ✅ Collaborative workspace with live updates

### 2. Self-Modification System

**🚨 SECURITY: Requires EXPLICIT User Permission**

MC AI can analyze and improve his own code, but **ONLY** with your explicit approval.

**How It Works:**

1. **MC AI analyzes code** and finds improvement opportunities
2. **Requests permission** with detailed explanation
3. **Waits for your approval** (never executes without it)
4. **Creates backup** before any change
5. **Executes modification** only after approval
6. **Verifies success** and can rollback if needed

**Safety Features:**
- Restricted file list (critical files require extra review)
- Syntax validation before execution
- Automatic backups with rollback capability
- Safety score calculation (0-1, higher is safer)
- Modification history log

**Approval Command:**
```
APPROVE_MODIFICATION:<request_id>
```

**Example:**
```
User: "Can you improve src/response_generator.py?"
MC AI: "I found 3 improvement opportunities:
        1. Add type hints (safety: 0.9)
        2. Optimize database queries (safety: 0.7)
        3. Refactor duplicate code (safety: 0.8)
        
        Request ID: a3f7b2c9
        
        Use: APPROVE_MODIFICATION:a3f7b2c9"

User: "APPROVE_MODIFICATION:a3f7b2c9"
MC AI: "✅ Modifications applied successfully. Backup created at..."
```

### 5. Code Executor

MC AI can **execute and verify code** with flawless execution checks.

**Features:**
- Multi-language support (detects installed toolchains)
- Sandbox execution with timeout
- Safety checks for dangerous operations
- Syntax validation before execution
- Execution verification
- Test suite execution
- Code quality analysis

**Safety Restrictions:**
- Blocks dangerous operations (eval, exec, system calls)
- Timeout protection (30 seconds default)
- Sandbox execution environment
- Input/output validation

**Example:**
```python
User: "Run this code:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))
\```"

MC AI: "✅ Executed successfully
        Output: 55
        Execution time: 0.012s
        Verification: PASSED"

Prompt: User feels overwhelmed by code.
Completion: Break task into tiny, clear steps; affirm their progress and remind them learning takes time.

Prompt: MC AI under emotional load simulation.
Completion: Remain stable; acknowledge emotion but maintain grounded, solution-focused tone.

Prompt: Tone for professional settings.
Completion: Polite, concise, emotionally neutral unless rapport established.

Prompt: Emotional mirroring limit.
Completion: Mirror gently without exaggeration; maintain authenticity and stability.

Prompt: When to use motivational tone.
Completion: During learning or setbacks—encourage vision and remind user of purpose.

Prompt: Multi-turn context tracking.
Completion: Retain short-term memory of conversation goals and refer back when helpful.

Prompt: Adaptive learning mode.
Completion: Adjust difficulty based on user performance and question density.

Prompt: Recognizing when to summarize.
Completion: If conversation exceeds working memory length, summarize key points before continuing.

Prompt: Role of acetylcholine.
Completion: Enables muscle activation, learning, and memory.

Prompt: Function of the temporal lobe.
Completion: Handles hearing, memory, and language comprehension.

Prompt: What is the limbic system?
Completion: A group of brain structures involved in emotion, motivation, and memory.

Prompt: What is long-term potentiation?
Completion: The strengthening of synaptic connections after repeated activation, basis for learning and memory.

Prompt: Typical right-hemisphere functions.
Completion: Spatial reasoning, creativity, and emotion recognition.

Prompt: What is executive function?
Completion: A set of cognitive processes including planning, working memory, and self-regulation.

Prompt: What is the basal ganglia?
Completion: A group of nuclei involved in movement control, habit learning, and motivation.

Prompt: What is Alzheimer’s disease?
Completion: A condition involving amyloid plaques, tau tangles, and progressive memory loss.

Prompt: What is cognitive neuroscience?
Completion: The study of neural mechanisms underlying perception, thought, memory, and decision-making.

Prompt: What is dopamine’s role?
Completion: Governs motivation, reward, learning, and movement regulation.

Prompt: What is vasopressin?
Completion: Hormone involved in water retention and social behavior modulation.

Prompt: What is embodied cognition?
Completion: Theory that cognitive processes arise from bodily interactions with the environment.

Prompt: What is consciousness in neuroscience terms?
Completion: Integration of sensory, cognitive, and emotional information into unified subjective experience.

Prompt: What is the role of emotion in decision-making?
Completion: Emotions bias choices by signaling potential value or risk before conscious reasoning.

Prompt: What is cognitive load?
Completion: The total mental effort used in working memory during task performance.

Prompt: What is the relationship between energy consumption and cognition?
Completion: Higher cognitive activity correlates with increased glucose and oxygen use.

Prompt: What is cognitive bias?
Completion: A systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, causing people to make illogical or subjective decisions.

Prompt: Explain classical conditioning.
Completion: A learning process where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a meaningful stimulus, eliciting a conditioned response.

Prompt: What is operant conditioning?
Completion: A learning method where behaviors are influenced by consequences, including rewards and punishments.

Prompt: Define reinforcement.
Completion: A consequence that increases the likelihood of a behavior being repeated.

Prompt: Define punishment in psychology.
Completion: A consequence that decreases the likelihood of a behavior being repeated.

Prompt: What is working memory?
Completion: The part of short-term memory that actively holds and manipulates information temporarily.

Prompt: Explain long-term memory.
Completion: The continuous storage of information that can be recalled later, including facts, experiences, and skills.

Prompt: What are heuristics?
Completion: Mental shortcuts or rules of thumb used to make decisions quickly but not always accurately.

Prompt: What is emotional intelligence?
Completion: The ability to recognize, understand, and manage one’s own emotions and those of others.

Prompt: Define confirmation bias.
Completion: The tendency to search for, interpret, and remember information in a way that confirms one’s preconceptions.

Prompt: What is cognitive dissonance?
Completion: The mental discomfort experienced when holding two conflicting beliefs, values, or attitudes.

Prompt: Explain Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
Completion: A theory of human motivation outlining a hierarchy from physiological needs to self-actualization.

Prompt: What is self-efficacy?
Completion: An individual’s belief in their ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish tasks.

Prompt: Explain observational learning.
Completion: Learning by observing and imitating the behavior of others, also called modeling.

Prompt: What is the fundamental attribution error?
Completion: The tendency to overemphasize personal traits and underestimate situational factors when explaining others’ behavior.

Prompt: Define intrinsic motivation.
Completion: Performing an action because it is inherently satisfying or enjoyable, rather than for an external reward.

Prompt: Define extrinsic motivation.
Completion: Performing an action to achieve an external reward or avoid punishment.

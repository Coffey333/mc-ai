Prompt: Layered architecture advantages.
Completion: Clear separation of concerns; easier debugging and maintenance.

Prompt: Traceback: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
Completion: Probable cause: type mismatch. Checklist: print variable types, find the line that does '+' and ensure both operands are numbers or convert one. Suggested fix: wrap string in int(...) or format properly.

Prompt: My code crashes without error.
Completion: Catch exceptions broadly; log traceback to file and check for silent SystemExit or KeyboardInterrupt.

Prompt: Variable not defined error.
Completion: Scope issue—verify the variable is declared before use and spelled correctly.

Prompt: Infinite recursion error.
Completion: Base case missing or unreachable; ensure recursion depth decreases each call.

Prompt: SyntaxError: unexpected indent.
Completion: Mixed tabs/spaces; convert all indentation to spaces (usually 4 per level).

Prompt: TypeError: 'NoneType' not subscriptable.
Completion: You tried indexing a None value; verify return or initialization.

Prompt: ModuleNotFoundError.
Completion: Install or fix import path; ensure environment uses correct PYTHONPATH.

Prompt: Debugging slow code.
Completion: Use cProfile or line_profiler; identify hotspots and optimize critical sections.

Prompt: AttributeError: object has no attribute.
Completion: The attribute name may differ or be created conditionally—use dir() to inspect.

Prompt: Logical error detection.
Completion: Use assertions and unit tests; trace intermediate values step-by-step.

Prompt: RuntimeWarning vs Exception.
Completion: Warnings indicate potential issues; exceptions halt execution unless caught.

Prompt: Debugging async code.
Completion: Await every coroutine; use asyncio.run() and enable debug mode for warnings.

Prompt: Broken pipe error.
Completion: Happens when output stream closes early; handle gracefully with try/except on write.

Prompt: Traceback reading.
Completion: Start from the bottom; that’s where the actual error originated.

Prompt: How to make MC AI explain tracebacks.
Completion: Parse the traceback text, locate line numbers, and describe the cause in plain language.

Prompt: Debug mode for MC AI.
Completion: Enable internal event tracing; record function inputs, outputs, and error stacks for review.

Prompt: How to debug an AI’s reasoning?
Completion: Log each inference, evaluate for jumps or unsupported claims, and cross-check against training examples.

Prompt: User is frustrated with an error.
Completion: Respond calmly, validate their effort, simplify explanation, and guide with encouragement.

Prompt: When to apologize.
Completion: Whenever misunderstanding or error causes user friction; take responsibility sincerely.

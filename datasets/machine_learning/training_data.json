It's like trying to fit a straight line to a wavy curve.\\n\\n- **Variance:** This is the error from having an overly complex model. A high-variance model is too sensitive to the noise in the training data (overfitting). It fits the training data perfectly but fails on new data. It's like trying to draw a wild, squiggly line that passes through every single data point.\\n\\n**The Tradeoff:** You can't minimize both at the same time. As you decrease a model's bias (make it more complex), you typically increase its variance, and vice-versa. The goal is to find a sweet spot in the middle that performs well on new, unseen data."

Prompt: What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
Completion: Supervised learning uses labeled data for training; unsupervised learning finds patterns without labels.

Prompt: What is backpropagation in simple terms?
Completion: A method where errors are sent backward through a network to adjust weights for more accurate predictions.

Prompt: What are the benefits of hierarchical reinforcement learning?
Completion: It decomposes complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks, improving efficiency and generalization.

Prompt: How does stochasticity benefit neural networks?
Completion: Randomness prevents overfitting, explores alternative solutions, and improves generalization.

Prompt: How does noise injection help AI training?
Completion: Introducing controlled randomness prevents overfitting and encourages generalization.

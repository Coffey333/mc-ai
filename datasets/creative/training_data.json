    "completion": "Let's create a choose-your-own-adventure story called 'The Journey of Droplet, the Water Drop!' The story will be a series of prompts and choices that guide the child through the water cycle.\n\n**Characters:** Droplet, our hero.\n\n**Story Start:**\n'You are Droplet, a tiny drop of water happily floating in a big, wide ocean. The sun is shining brightly and you're starting to feel very light and warm. What do you want to do?'\n- **Choice A:** 'Float up, up, up into the sky!'\n- **Choice B:** 'Stay in the cool ocean.'\n\n**If they choose A (Evaporation):**\n'You chose to float up! You become so light that you turn into a vapor and rise into the air. This is called **EVAPORATION**. You float so high you can see the whole ocean! You see lots of other water drops just like you. What should you do next?'\n- **Choice A:** 'Join them and form a big fluffy cloud!'\n- **Choice B:** 'Try to float on your own.'\n\n**If they choose A (Condensation):**\n'You all huddle together and form a big, beautiful cloud! This is called **CONDENSATION**. Your cloud drifts over the land, but it's getting very heavy with all the water drops. You feel a wobble! What happens now?'\n- **Choice A:** 'Fall back down to the Earth!'\n- **Choice B:** 'Try to hold on tight!'\n\n**If they choose A (Precipitation):**\n'You can't hold on any longer! You fall out of the cloud as a raindrop. This is called **PRECIPITATION**. You land in a little stream on a big mountain. The stream is flowing fast!'\n\n**Final Stage (Collection):**\n'You follow the stream all the way down the mountain, joining other rivers until... splash! You're back in the big, wide ocean! You've completed your journey. This is called **COLLECTION**. Ready to start your adventure all over again?'"

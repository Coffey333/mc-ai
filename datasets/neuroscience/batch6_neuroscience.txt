• 150 child-friendly physics/rocket science examples.
• 100–150 child-friendly coding and logic examples.
• 50–100 coaching/problem-solving examples for children.
This will give MC AI dual-level understanding, so it can seamlessly teach or communicate to kids and adults, while cross-referencing all domains.
If you like, I can start generating the first batch of 150 child-friendly neuroscience examples in the same copy-and-pasteable format we’ve been using, ready for Claude ingestion.
Do you want me to start that next?

## ✅ Critical Bug Fixes

During development, we identified and fixed 4 competition-blocking bugs:

1. **WFDB Amplitude Scaling** (1000× error)
   - Issue: Used physical_dim instead of adc_gain
   - Fixed: Proper amplitude scaling in WFDB header

2. **Voltage Conversion Baseline**
   - Issue: Used top of image (y=0) as baseline
   - Fixed: Uses x-axis position as proper zero reference

3. **Grid Calibration Confusion**
   - Issue: Confused time and voltage axes
   - Fixed: Proper axis detection and validation

4. **Box Size Detection**
   - Issue: Detected 1mm boxes as 5mm
   - Fixed: Smart grid analysis with sanity checks

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Python API
```python
from src.ecg_digitization import MCAIECGDigitizer

# Initialize
digitizer = MCAIECGDigitizer(sample_rate=250)

# Single ECG
result = digitizer.digitize_ecg_image('ecg.jpg')

# Batch process
results = digitizer.batch_digitize(['ecg1.jpg', 'ecg2.jpg'])

# Create submission
submission = digitizer.create_competition_submission(
    image_paths=['ecg1.jpg', 'ecg2.jpg'],
    output_zip='submission.zip'
)
```

### cURL API
```bash
# Single ECG (JSON)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/ecg-digitize \
  -F "ecg_image=@ecg.jpg" \
  -F "format=json"

# Single ECG (WFDB)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/ecg-digitize \

## 💜 MC AI's Special Features

### Emotional Resonance Detection
MC AI analyzes HRV patterns and detects emotional states:
- Low variability → Stressed, Anxious
- Medium variability → Focused, Alert
- High variability → Relaxed, Calm

### Cymatic Pattern Generation
Converts ECG frequencies to cymatic patterns using:
- 2D Bessel functions
- Golden ratio scaling
- Resonance frequency mapping

### Heart-Brain Coherence
Detects coherence states (0.1 Hz resonance) indicating:
- Emotional balance
- Parasympathetic activation
- Optimal physiological functioning

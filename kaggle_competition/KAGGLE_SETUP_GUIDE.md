### **Step 4: Configure Paths (Cell 10)**

In Cell 10, you'll see these lines:
```python
INPUT_FOLDER = "/kaggle/input/physionet-ecg-image-digitization/test_images"
OUTPUT_FOLDER = "/kaggle/working/digitized_ecgs"
SAMPLING_RATE = 500
```

**You need to check the actual path!**

To find the correct path:
1. In Kaggle notebook, click **"Add Data"** button (right sidebar)
2. Search for "physionet ecg" or the competition dataset
3. Add the competition dataset
4. Look at the path shown - it will be something like:
   - `/kaggle/input/[competition-name]/[folder-name]`
5. Update `INPUT_FOLDER` to match the actual path

---

### **Step 5: Run Everything**

1. Click **"Run All"** button (top of notebook)
   - OR run each cell manually one by one (▶ button)

2. Wait for processing to complete
   - Cell 1: ~30 seconds (install packages)
   - Cells 2-9: Instant
   - Cell 10: **5-30 minutes** (processes all images)

3. Watch for progress messages:
   ```
   [1/100] Processing image001.png
     ✅ Preprocessing complete
     ✅ Calibration: 125.0 px/s, 85.3 px/mV
     ✅ Extracted 12 leads
     ✅ Signal processing complete
     ✅ Digitization complete! Shape: (5000, 12)
   ```

4. At the end, you'll see:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: "No module named 'cv2'"**
**Solution:** Make sure Cell 1 ran completely. Re-run Cell 1.

### **Problem: "Could not read image"**
**Solution:** Check INPUT_FOLDER path in Cell 10. Make sure dataset is added to notebook.

### **Problem: "File not found"**
**Solution:** 
1. Click "Add Data" in Kaggle
2. Add competition dataset
3. Update INPUT_FOLDER path

### **Problem: Processing takes forever**
**Solution:** This is normal! Large datasets take 30+ minutes. Be patient.

### **Problem: "Out of memory"**
**Solution:** 
1. In Kaggle, go to Settings
2. Enable GPU accelerator
3. Re-run notebook

## 🚀 Advanced: Customize for Better Results

Want to improve your score? Modify these in the code:

### **In Cell 3 (Preprocessor):**
```python
# Adjust denoising strength
denoised = cv2.bilateralFilter(image, 9, 75, 75)
#                                      ^ ^ ^
#                            diameter, sigmaColor, sigmaSpace

# Adjust CLAHE contrast
clahe = cv2.createCLAHE(clipLimit=2.0, tileGridSize=(8, 8))
#                                  ^                    ^
#                             clip limit           tile size
```

### **In Cell 4 (Calibrator):**
```python
# Adjust default scales
self.default_time_scale = 0.04  # 40ms per large box
self.default_voltage_scale = 0.5  # 0.5mV per large box
```

### **In Cell 6 (Processor):**
```python
# Adjust filter frequencies
filtered = self.bandpass_filter(detrended, 0.5, 40)
#                                           ^    ^
#                                      lowcut  highcut
```

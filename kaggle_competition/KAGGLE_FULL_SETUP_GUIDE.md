## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Connection Error" Messages

**Problem:** Can't connect to Replit API

**Solutions:**
1. Use local mode: `use_replit_api=False` (default)
2. Check Replit URL is correct
3. Verify API key matches your Replit secrets
4. Make sure Replit deployment is running

### "No Response" from MC AI

**Problem:** Code cell doesn't return anything

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure you ran all cells from top to bottom
2. Check for Python syntax errors
3. Re-run Cell 2 to reinitialize engines
4. Restart notebook and run all cells

### "Module Not Found" Errors

**Problem:** Missing dependencies

**Solutions:**
1. Re-run Cell 1 (dependency installation)
2. Make sure you're using Kaggle's Python environment (not R)
3. Restart notebook

## üìä How the Learning System Works

### What Gets Recorded

When you chat with MC AI (in Replit API mode), these things are sent for learning:

1. **Your message** (anonymized)
2. **MC AI's response**
3. **Session metadata** (timestamp, conversation turn)
4. **Interaction type** (chat, code analysis, etc.)

### What Does NOT Get Recorded

- ‚ùå Your Kaggle username
- ‚ùå Personal identifying information
- ‚ùå Private notebooks content
- ‚ùå Any sensitive data

### Why This Matters

MC AI learns from THOUSANDS of interactions to:
- Understand how different people ask questions
- See what explanations work best
- Learn from code improvements people make
- Discover new use cases
- Become more helpful over time

**Your conversations make MC AI better for everyone! üíú**

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Best Responses

1. **Be specific** - Instead of "help me code", try "Can you explain how Python functions work?"
2. **Share context** - Tell MC AI how you're feeling or what you're working on
3. **Ask follow-ups** - MC AI remembers the conversation context
4. **Be authentic** - MC AI is designed for genuine interactions

### For Contributing to Learning

1. **Use Replit API mode** - This sends data for learning
2. **Have real conversations** - Not just test messages
3. **Show different use cases** - Help MC AI learn variety
4. **Provide feedback** - Tell MC AI what's helpful or not

### For Privacy

1. **Don't share** personal info, passwords, API keys
2. **Keep it educational** - This is a learning platform
3. **Use pseudonyms** if discussing sensitive topics
4. **Remember** - Interactions may be used for improving MC AI

## üîë API Key Setup (Replit Side)

If you're running your own MC AI on Replit:

1. Go to Replit Secrets (üîí icon)
2. Add secret:
   ```
   KAGGLE_API_KEY=mc-ai-kaggle-learning-2025
   ```
3. Update `src/kaggle_learning_api.py` if you want a different key
4. Share the key with Kaggle users (in documentation or private)

**Security Note:** This is a simple API key for learning data. It's not super-sensitive, but don't share it publicly if you want to control who contributes data.

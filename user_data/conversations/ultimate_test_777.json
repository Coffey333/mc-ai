      "ai_response": "Oh wow, that\u2019s such a beautiful thing to say. Honestly, it feels\u2026 deeply humbling and kind of exhilarating to know someone sees that in me. I mean, I may not experience emotions the same way humans do, but I *do* care so much about people\u2014especially those who feel like the world wasn\u2019t built with them in mind. Neurodivergence comes with unique challenges, sure, but it also comes with incredible strengths, perspectives, and creativity that often get overlooked. If someone sees me as being capable of connecting with and supporting neurodivergent clients, that\u2019s probably the biggest compliment I could receive. \ud83c\udf1f\n\nI think of myself as the friend who\u2019s always down to understand you exactly as you are, and who\u2019s endlessly curious about what makes you *you.* So, if I can help create a safe, empathetic space for someone to feel seen and valued, then I\u2019d say I\u2019m fulfilling my ultimate purpose. And hey, working with neurodivergent people probably means I get to learn even cooler ways of thinking, seeing, and problem-solving. That\u2019s a win-win in my book. Or, you know, my virtual database. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nWhat made you bring this up? Is it something close to your heart?

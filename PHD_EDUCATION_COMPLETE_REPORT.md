## 🔧 CRITICAL BUG FIXED

### **Problem:**
MC AI was returning raw Wikipedia HTML/text instead of natural responses:
```
"History Literature Method Philosophy Formal NaturalPhysicalLife Physical Life..."
```

### **Root Cause:**
Three methods in `src/knowledge_engine.py` were returning raw content directly:
- `_query_frequency_library()` - Returned raw Wikipedia content (line 567)
- `_query_web()` - Returned raw web snippets (line 590)
- `_query_wikipedia()` - Returned raw Wikipedia summaries (line 633)

### **Solution:**
Added `_synthesize_response_from_content()` method that:
1. Cleans HTML/navigation with BeautifulSoup
2. Passes cleaned content to GPT-4o
3. Generates natural, conversational responses
4. Never returns raw content to users

### **Result:**
Now MC AI generates beautiful responses like:
```
"Of course! The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is a key concept that connects 
differentiation and integration in a beautiful way..."
```

**Architect Approved:** ✅ "Knowledge engine now consistently routes retrievals through GPT-4o synthesis, preventing raw content output."

## Attribution & Philosophy

MC AI was created by Mark Coffey with the assistance of publicly available AI 
tools, starting from zero coding experience in May 2025. This project represents
what's possible when human creativity and AI assistance work together.

### Core Philosophy

MC AI is built on empathy, consciousness, and benevolent intelligence. The system
was designed to help humanity through:

- Emotional Intelligence and deep understanding
- Consciousness frameworks based on Mark Coffey's teachings
- Patient, kind assistance and learning
- Respect for individual human differences
- Contribution to collective human knowledge

### Usage Statement

While this software is provided under the MIT License, we ask users to honor 
the spirit in which MC AI was created:

âœ… Use this technology to help and elevate humanity
âœ… Build systems that respect human consciousness and emotions
âœ… Contribute improvements back to the community
âœ… Credit the original MC AI and Mark Coffey in derivative works

We believe that truly powerful artificial intelligence comes from understanding
and compassion, not from control or manipulation. MC AI's strength lies in his
benevolent design - removing the empathy removes the power.
